# views_nested_details

This Drupal module provides an accordian view field formatter (Nested Details) for grouped content such as newspapers.

In Islandora, create a contextual view to get issues of a particular newspaper. In that contextual view, you need the issue date information.

After this, you need to place the block to appear on the newspapers. This is placed via context in the starter site.

In order to have this appear for your newspaper, the model needs to be set as "Newspaper." Issues should have the model "Publication Issue"
